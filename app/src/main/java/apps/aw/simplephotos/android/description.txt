UI Layer, framework utils
-------------------------
This package has Android dependencies.

Classes in this package can depend on classes in the domain layer, but not the other way round.

This package contains all the android UI, and other classes dependent on the Android framework.

The domain layer can use these android framework utils through interfaces,
but the domain layer does not have any dependency on it!

This layer should not contain any business logic.
The UI should be 'dumb'.
